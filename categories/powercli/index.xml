      <description>You know the situation when the host stops reporting its performance counters, do you? CPU and RAM load are showing nils.. This snippet will fix the issue:
Get-View -ViewType HostSystem ` -Filter @{&amp;#39;Summary.QuickStats.Uptime&amp;#39;=&amp;#39;^0$&amp;#39;} ` -Property Name,ConfigManager | % { (Get-View $_.ConfigManager.ServiceSystem).RestartService(&amp;#39;vpxa&amp;#39;) } 2&amp;gt;$null </description>

      <title>The power of Get-View</title>

      <description>Today we&amp;rsquo;re going to discover very powerful Get-View cmdlet. I&amp;rsquo;m sure most of you have seen it in many scripts found across the web. This cmdlet returns .NET view objects thus exposing API methods and properties to PowerShell environment. This is crucial in advanced manipulating with vSphere infrastructure.
First, it&amp;rsquo;s worth mentioning that getting implementation objects (those produced by Get-VM, Get-VMHost, etc) takes more time than getting view objects, though in the last versions I found the gap decreased significantly.</description>

      <title>VMware UUIDs</title>

      <description>Hi everybody! My first post is about UUIDs - identifiers used for virtual machines in vSphere infrastructure. If you ever looked in vm config file (*.vmx) you could see 3 different lines containing 128-bit hex numbers. They are:
 uuid.bios uuid.location vc.uuid  Because of having some issues with software licensing inside guest OS I decided to explore what the every value is responsible for. Web hasn&amp;rsquo;t gave me the complete answer about the meaning of all of these parameters so my investigations led me to the following conclusion I&amp;rsquo;d like to share with you.</description>

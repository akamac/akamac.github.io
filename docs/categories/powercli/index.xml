      <title>OBN (Object By Name) transformation</title>

      <description>You might have known that most of PowerCLI cmdlets parameters accept objects or object names (with wildcard characters allowed). Take a look at New-VM cmdlet: you can pass strings to VMHost, ResourcePool, Datastore, etc. parameters as well as the objects itself. Or maybe you&amp;#8217;ve even never noticed this since it just works!
Want the same behavior for your own functions? No problem! Use the function below to perform transparent transformation from any eligible object to the object you need (View or Impl).</description>

      <title>Retrieve CDP/LLDP info</title>
      <link>https://purple-screen.com/2014/06/10/retrieve-cdp/lldp-info/</link>

      <description>Search for an easy way to get CDP/LLDP info for any given ESXi physical port (vmnic)? Here it is!
It relies on ObnTransformation from my previous post and also depends on PowerShell Community Extensions for ?? alias (Invoke-NullCoalescing). You can replace the latter with the simple if in case you don&amp;#8217;t have PSCX installed.
Keep in mind that (some) devices return MAC instead of the management IP in LLDP info.</description>

      <description>You know the situation when the host stops reporting its performance counters, do you? CPU and RAM load are showing nils.. A simple two-liner to fix the issue at your disposal:
Get-View -ViewType HostSystem -Filter @{&#39;Summary.QuickStats.Uptime&#39;=&#39;^0$&#39;} -Property Name,ConfigManager | % { (Get-View $_.ConfigManager.ServiceSystem).RestartService(&#39;vpxa&#39;) } 2&amp;gt;$null &amp;nbsp;</description>

      <title>The power of Get-View</title>
      <link>https://purple-screen.com/2014/02/05/the-power-of-get-view/</link>

      <description>Today we&amp;#8217;re going to discover very useful Get-View cmdlet. I&amp;#8217;m sure most of you have seen it in many scripts found across the web. This cmdlet returns .NET view objects thus exposing API methods and properties to PowerShell environment. This is crucial in advanced manipulating with vSphere infrastructure.
First it&amp;#8217;s worth mentioning that getting implementation objects (those produced by Get-VM, Get-VMHost, etc) takes more time than getting view objects, though in the last versions I found the gap decreased significantly.</description>

      <title>Fast Suspend/Resume</title>

      <description>Have you ever come across the term in subj? It&amp;#8217;s time to reveal what it stands for.
First, three examples when this action can be performed.
To enable CBT for virtual machine in addition to make vm reconfiguration one need to perform so called stun/unstun cycle for vm. This could be power on/off, suspend/resume, create/remove snapshot, vm migration.
Another example is changing the build type for running vm (release/debug/stats). This can be done in vm advanced settings tab or via command line utils.</description>

      <title>Esxcli namespace tree</title>

      <description>Every time a new ESXi version released I wonder what the functionality was added to esxcli. As you know all available namespaces and commands can be retrieved by typing esxcli command list in the console. To make the output look pretty I&amp;#8217;ve written a couple of lines of PoSH code that generates the handy namespaces tree view.
$esxcli = Get-VMHost $Name | Get-EsxCli $EsxcliNamespaceFile = [IO.File]::CreateText(&#39;D:\esxcli.txt&#39;) $EsxcliNamespaceTree = $esxcli.esxcli.command.list() $Commands = @() foreach ($Namespace in $EsxcliNamespaceTree) { $Commands += @{Path = $Namespace.</description>

      <title>VMware UUIDs</title>
      <link>https://purple-screen.com/2013/05/31/vmware-uuids/</link>

      <description>Hi everybody! My first post is about UUIDs &amp;#8211; identifiers used for virtual machines in vSphere infrastructure. If you ever looked in vm config file (*.vmx) you could see 3 different lines containing 128-bit hex numbers. They are:
 uuid.bios uuid.location vc.uuid  Because of having some issues with software licensing inside guest OS I decided to explore what the every value is responsible for. Web hasn&amp;#8217;t gave me the complete answer about the meaning of all of these parameters so my investigations led me to the following conclusion I&amp;#8217;d like to share with you.</description>

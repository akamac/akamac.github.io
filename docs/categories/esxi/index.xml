      <description>As opposed to the physical RDM mode with the virtual one after expanding the LUN on the storage array side and rescanning HBA vm still can&amp;#8217;t see the increased capacity. The official VMware tutorial says to shutdown vm and re-add RDM. This isn&amp;#8217;t acceptable. The hint to make it happen with no downtime is to vMotion vm after rescanning HBA on the destination host. That&amp;#8217;s it!</description>

      <description>You know the situation when the host stops reporting its performance counters, do you? CPU and RAM load are showing nils.. A simple two-liner to fix the issue at your disposal:
Get-View -ViewType HostSystem -Filter @{&#39;Summary.QuickStats.Uptime&#39;=&#39;^0$&#39;} -Property Name,ConfigManager | % { (Get-View $_.ConfigManager.ServiceSystem).RestartService(&#39;vpxa&#39;) } 2&amp;gt;$null &amp;nbsp;</description>

      <description>Have you ever come across the term in subj? It&amp;#8217;s time to reveal what it stands for.
First, three examples when this action can be performed.
To enable CBT for virtual machine in addition to make vm reconfiguration one need to perform so called stun/unstun cycle for vm. This could be power on/off, suspend/resume, create/remove snapshot, vm migration.
Another example is changing the build type for running vm (release/debug/stats). This can be done in vm advanced settings tab or via command line utils.</description>

      <description>You might have known that most of PowerCLI cmdlets parameters accept objects or object names (with wildcard characters allowed). Take a look at New-VM cmdlet: you can pass strings to VMHost, ResourcePool, Datastore, etc. parameters as well as the objects itself. Or maybe you&amp;#8217;ve even never noticed this since it just works!
Want the same behavior for your own functions? No problem! Use the function below to perform transparent transformation from any eligible object to the object you need (View or Impl).</description>

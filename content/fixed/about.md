Hi! My name is Alexey Miasoedov.

Currently I'm Senior Core System Administrator [@Intermedia](https://www.intermedia.net), based in St. Petersburg, Russia.

This is a second revival of the the blog after being down for a year+.
A lot of content was archived and new posts will mostly focus on open source.

I hope you'll find the content useful. Don't shy to ping me in [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexeymiasoedov) or [email](mailto:alexey.miasoedov@gmail.com) if you have any questions or have something to offer.

Thanks for reading!

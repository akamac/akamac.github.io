Use all the power of PowerShell with <a href="http://www.netcmdlets.com" title="NetCmdlets" target="_blank">NetCmdlets</a>. Out of box you can: gain SSH access to ESXi 5.x hosts from PowerShell, work with multiple internet protocols (IMAP/POP/WebDAV/DNS/FTP/etc), deploy portable syslog server in seconds and much more.

_Unfortunately community edition doesn&#8217;t support encryption-enabled cmdlets. To use SSH, SFTP you need to upgrade to paid version._

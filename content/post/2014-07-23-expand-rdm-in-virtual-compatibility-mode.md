As opposed to the physical RDM mode with the virtual one after expanding the LUN on the storage array side and rescanning HBA vm still can&#8217;t see the increased capacity. The official VMware tutorial says to shutdown vm and re-add RDM. This isn&#8217;t acceptable.Â The hint to make it happen with no downtime is to vMotion vm after rescanning HBA on the destination host. That&#8217;s it!

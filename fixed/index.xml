      <description>Hi! My name is Alexey Miasoedov.
Currently I&amp;rsquo;m Senior Core System Administrator @Intermedia, based in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This is a second revival of the the blog after being down for a year+. A lot of content was archived and new posts will mostly focus on open source.
I hope you&amp;rsquo;ll find the content useful. Don&amp;rsquo;t shy to ping me in LinkedIn or email if you have any questions or have something to offer.</description>

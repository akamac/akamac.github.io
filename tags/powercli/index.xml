      <description>Hi everybody! My first post is about UUIDs - identifiers used for virtual machines in vSphere infrastructure. If you ever looked in vm config file (*.vmx) you could see 3 different lines containing 128-bit hex numbers. They are:
 uuid.bios uuid.location vc.uuid  Because of having some issues with software licensing inside guest OS I decided to explore what the every value is responsible for. Web hasn&amp;rsquo;t gave me the complete answer about the meaning of all of these parameters so my investigations led me to the following conclusion I&amp;rsquo;d like to share with you.</description>

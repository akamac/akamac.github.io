      <description>Few words outside the virtualization world yet PoSH scripting related.
I&amp;#8217;ve been working for a while in the company that uses Omnitracker as a helpdesk and incident management solution. Using its web interface as well as thick client isn&amp;#8217;t the best experience. And when it comes to do it on a regular basis it turns to a nightmare especially for a scripting guy like me. So what should we do in this situation?</description>
